<h1> Lighting </h1>
<h2> What are the differences? </h2>

<p>  <strong> Lighting</strong> is very important when it comes to things such as <strong> photos and/or films.</strong> But what are the different types of lighting? In fact, there are <strong>4 different types of lighitng</strong>, which are: </p>
<ol> 
  <li>Hard</li>
  <li>Soft</li>
  <li>Specular</li>
  <li>Diffused</li>
  </ol>

<h1> Hard Lighting</h1>
<p>When someone refers to <i>hard light</i>, they are usually referring to the light that <strong> a harsh, but well-defined shadow</strong> on what is it illuminating. This would give it a very quick and immediate transition between the highlights and shadows. To create this effect one would use a smaller light than the object so it can create more focus on specific features. This is usually used to create <u>tense scenes</u>. </p>

<br><br>

<h1> Soft Lighting </h1>
<p>On the other hand, <i>soft light</i> only gives us <strong>few hard shadows but is bright and balanced.</strong>  The transition of highlight to shadow is gradual and similar to a gradient, smooth even.In this case, to get this effect one would need to use a big light and bring it closer to the subject. This lightining helps hide acne, smooth wrinkles and bring out someones eyes. This is usually used in <u>photography</u> like: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Fashion</li>
    <li>Travel</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Portraits</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h1> Specular Lighting</h1>
<p> If a photographer states that they used <i>specular lighting</i>, then that means that they managed to <strong>identify extreamly bright highlights</strong>  when the light source hits the surface of the object. It then is <strong>reflected back to the camera</strong>  which then show up as a white spot of light. This usually reflects things such as moist and/or oily areas of the face, or extreamly shiny objects. This form of light is used mostly for <u>adding dimention to object to make them look more three dimentional</u>.     </p>

<br>
<h1> Diffused Lighting </h1>
<p><i>Diffuesd lighting</i>is a form of soft light (as explained before) however, the difference is that this form of soft light is <strong>filtered by something like, for example, sunlight coming from a sheer curtain</strong>. In this case, the photographer could use coloured plastic or a sheet to get the desired look on what they want their photograph to look like. This form of light <u>eliminates shadows and softens the face while also allowing the image to look warmer.</u> </p>
